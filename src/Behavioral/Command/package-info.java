 * Command design pattern is used to implement loose coupling in a request-response model.
 *
 * In command pattern, the request is send to the invoker and invoker pass
 * it to the encapsulated command object.

 * Letâ€™s say we want to provide a File System utility with methods to open,
 * write and close file.
 * This file system utility should support multiple operating systems such as Windows and Unix.
